# viewmodel-changer
just a fabric mod that gives you the ability to change your viewmodel.  
done for volker1 on discord.  
# how-to-use
to open the gui, press the BACKSLASH key.  
inside it, you'll see switches and sliders.  
for sliders, you can use either your mouse wheel to change the values or click on a specific spot and hope to get it right.  
for switches, just click on it to negate the value of that setting.
