# viewmodel-changer ported to later versions (THIS IS A FORK)
Hey everyone, this is my fork of viewmodel-changer with compatibility for various later versions of Minecraft - you can see the versions this mod has been updated for on the [Releases page](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/viewmodel-changer/releases). Please create any issues you deem relevant for me to resolve in this repository, or check out other ways to contact me on my GitHub profile! You can download the mod from [here](https://github.com/CyberFlameGO/viewmodel-changer/releases/latest) \(you just need to click on the `viewmodel-*.x.jar` \(it'll have a version, which is 1.5 at the time of posting\) file under the `Assets` subheading\).  
**Read on for the original README content for mod instructions, among other things.**

> ## viewmodel-changer
> just a fabric mod that gives you the ability to change your viewmodel.  
> done for volker1 on discord.  
> ## how-to-use
> to open the gui, press the BACKSLASH key.  
> inside it, you'll see switches and sliders.  
> for sliders, you can use either your mouse wheel to change the values or click on a specific spot and hope to get it right.  
> for switches, just click on it to negate the value of that setting.
